The 3-letter site identification code for Ushuaia, Argentina (TDF) was 
changed to USH to be consistent with the WMO GAWSIS. 

2011-10-07

We have introduced the term "measurement group", which identifies
the group within NOAA and INSTAAR that made the actual measurement.
We can now have multiple groups measuring some of the same trace 
gas species in our discrete samples.  

Measurement groups within NOAA and INSTAAR are 

  ccgg:  NOAA Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases (CCGG)
  hats:  NOAA Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species (HATS)
  arl:   INSTAAR Atmospheric Research Laboratory (ARL)
  sil:   INSTAAR Stable Isotope Laboratory (SIL)
  curl:  INSTAAR Laboratory for Radiocarbon Preparation and Research (CURL)

We have also changed the file naming convention (see section "DATA - FILE 
NAME DESCRIPTION").

Project-specific notes:

2017-07-27

Method codes and sample locations were edited for accuracy.
Edited sites are: ZEP, BKT, OXK, CGO, RPB, ASC, CHR, ICE,
KEY, KUM, and TAP

2016-07-07

Incorrect sample dates from Ulaan Uul, Mogolia (UUM) from
20 Aug. 2013 through 30 Sept. 2015 were corrected on 
13 May 2016.

2016-07-07

Since 24 Jan 2015, air samples from Negev Desert, Isreal (WIS)
are collected at 29.9731N, 35.0567E, 156 masl; the old location 
was 30.8595N, 34.7809E, 482 masl.

2016-07-07

Since 03 Dec 2015, sampling in Natal, Brazil (NAT) was moved
from 5.5147S, 35.2603W, 20 masl to 5.7952S, 35.1853W, 87 masl.

2015-11-20

Updated the content and format of event files to include elevation in 
meters above sea level (masl) and sample collection intake height in 
meters above ground level (magl). Elevation plus collection intake 
height equals altitude, which has always been included in the NOAA 
distribution. In adding these 2 fields, the event number column
has moved. The new format is described in Sections 7.3 and 7.4.

Users may find minor changes (from earlier distributions) to reported 
monthly mean values for the beginning months of data records.  These 
changes are due to minor corrections to our curve fitting methods as
first described by Thoning et al. (JGR,1989).

2013-08-27

Coordinates of some of the sample locations have changed.
These changes improve the specified location based on new
information.  Changes tend to be minor and do not necessarily
reflect a change in the actual sampling location.

2011-10-01

The data file format has been modified to include the measurement group
and, additionally, the sample collection and analysis times now include
second information (e.g., 2011 03 15 23 06 12).  See section 7.3 for
details.

2010-10-01

The format of the NOAA ESRL data records has been changed to include
an estimate of the uncertainty associated with each measurement.  The
determination of the estimate is trace gas specific and described in
section 6 (INTRODUCTION).

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Parameter-specific notes:

2018-07-30

1. Uncertainties (68% c.i.) were estimated for all CO2
measurements. Uncertainity entries of -999.99 occur
when a reasonable uncertainty could not be calculated.

2. In 2017, began using N.. to flag samples not meeting
pair agreement criterion. 

2016-07-07

We discovered a small leak in the intake line of the portable
sampler at Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland (ICE) that affected CO2.
All samples from 1 July 2009 through 28 June 2016 were
flagged N.. for CO2.

2012-08-03

Corrections for drifting reference gas cylinders have been
applied to all samples measured on the following instruments
through the specified date.

Instrument ID             Analysis Date

   L3                      thru 2009-10
   L8                      thru 2010-06
   L10                     thru 2010-10


2011-10-13

Discrete (flask) CO2 mole fractions from 1980 to 2006 have all
been recalculated to bring them into the WMO X2007 Mole Fraction
Scale (X07). The data since 2007 were already on the X07 scale.
WMO X2007 is based on repeated manometric measurements of the NOAA
primary standards (Zhao et al. 2006) and comparison of those results
to similar measurements made over a period of more than 10 years at
Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  The difference between the X07
and the previous scales propagated by SIO and NOAA (X83, X87, etc.)
is ~0.2 ppm (X07-previous) in the 1980s, decreasing to ~0.1 ppm in
the late 1990s, and to 0.0 ppm by 2006. The recalculation of individual
measurements was accomplished by first determining the X07 values for
the reference gases used to measure the air samples and then using those
values with the raw data (NDIR voltages) to recompute mole fractions
for each sample.

1999-01-01

Corrections have been applied to CO2 mole fractions measured
on the flask analysis apparatus in use from July 1987 through
April 1998.  The corrections are +0.1 ppm to samples measured
from July 1987 through 18 November 1993, and +0.24 ppm to samples
measured from 19 November 1993 through 10 April 1998.

Corrections for drifting reference gas cylinders have been
applied to all samples measured during 1995 through April 2008
on system L3 and 1998 through May 2007 on systems S2 and L3.

Files obtained previously from this site should be discarded and
replaced with the revised files contained in this version.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. INTRODUCTION

CO2 dry air mole fractions reported in these files were
measured by a nondispersive infrared absorption
technique in air samples collected in glass flasks at
NOAA ESRL Carbon Cycle Cooperative Global Air Sampling 
Network sites. Measurements are reported on the X2007 CO2
mole fraction scale. Calibration procedures are given in
Komhyr et al., 1983; Komhyr et al., 1985; Thoning et al.,
1987, and Thoning et al., 1995.  Analysis and interpretation
of the data have been reported by Komhyr et al., 1985; 
Conway et al., 1988; Tans et al., 1989a; Tans et al., 
1990, and Conway et al., 1994.

The file co2_flask_system.ps is a postscript file 
explaining the operation of the flask analysis system used 
from July 1987 through April 1998.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7. DATA - GENERAL COMMENTS

Carbon dioxide (CO2) in ambient and standard air samples is
detected using a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzer.
The measurement of CO2 in air is made relative to standards 
whose CO2 mole fraction is determined with high precision and 
accuracy. Because detector response is non-linear in the range
of atmospheric levels, ambient samples are bracketed during 
analysis by a set of reference standards used to calibrate 
detector response. Measurements are reported in units of 
micromol/mol (10^-6 mol CO2 per mol of dry air or parts per 
million (ppm)). Measurements are directly traceable to the 
WMO CO2 mole fraction scale.

Uncertainties of the CO2 measurements are now included.
Key components of it are our ability to propagate the WMO XCO2
scale to working standards, the repeatability of the analyzers
used for sample measurement, and agreement between pairs of
samples collected simultaneously.  Zhao and Tans (2006)
determined that the internal consistency of working standards
is +/- 0.02 ppm (68% confidence interval). The typical
repeatability of the analyzers, based on repeated 
measurements of natural air from a cylinder, is +/- 0.03 ppm.
Average pair agreement across the entire sampling network is
+/- 0.07 ppm.

The Pacific Ocean Cruise (POC, travelling between the US west coast
and New Zealand or Australia) data have been merged and grouped into 
5 degree latitude bins.  For the South China Sea cruises (SCS) the 
data are grouped in 3 degree latitude bins.

Sampling intervals are approximately weekly for the fixed sites
and average one sample every 3 weeks per latitude zone for POC and
about one sample every week per latitude for SCS.

Historically, samples have been collected using two general methods:
flushing and then pressurizing glass flasks with a pump, or opening a
stopcock on an evacuated glass flask; since 28 April 2003, only the
former method is used.  During each sampling event, a pair of flasks 
is filled.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
1.  Data for all species may not be available for all sites listed 
in the table.
2.  The exact location of a sampling site recorded in our database
may change or become better defined over time.  The latitude,
longitude, and altitude of a sample event is based on the best
information available at the time of sample collection.  Differences
in sample position associated with a particular site may be due
to the site moving or changes in technology that permit a more
accurate location determination.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.4 DATA - EVENT WITH MULTIPLE PARAMETERS

On special request we can distribute a "merged" file, which
includes for each sampling event, measurement results for muliple 
parameters or trace gas species.  A merged file does not include all 
information found in a single parameter data file.  For example,
merged files exclude measurement uncertainty, analysis instrument 
ID and date and time for each parameter.  Thus, the single parameter
data file is our most comprehensive data archive. 

The format of a merged file is slightly different from a single parameter event file.
A "merged" file will have the word "merge" in the parameter field of the file name.  
The file name does not inform on the number of parameters included in the file.

Merged data files use the following naming scheme (see Section 7.2):

     merge_[site]_[project]_[lab ID number]_[measurement group]_[optional qualifiers].txt

(ex) merge_pocn30_surface-flask_1_ccgg.txt contains ccgg measurement results for two or
     more parameters for all surface flask samples collected on the Pacific Ocean Cruise 
     sampling platform and grouped at 30N +/- 2.5 degrees.

(ex) merge_brw_surface-flask_1_ccgg.txt contains ccgg measurement results for two or more
     parameters for all surface flask samples collected at Barrow, Alaska.

The data files contain multiple lines of header information followed by one 
record for each atmospheric measurement of a single parameter or trace gas species.

Fields are defined as follows:

Field 1:    [SITE CODE] The three-character sampling location code (see above).

Field 2:    [YEAR] The sample collection date and time in UTC.
Field 3:    [MONTH]
Field 4:    [DAY]
Field 5:    [HOUR]
Field 6:    [MINUTE]
Field 7:    [SECOND]

Field 8:    [FLASK ID] The sample container ID.

Field 9:    [METHOD] A single-character code that identifies the sample 
             collection method.  The codes are:

             P - Sample collected using a portable, battery
                 powered pumping unit.  Two flasks are
                 connected in series, flushed with air, and then

7.5 QC FLAGS

NOAA ESRL uses a 3-column quality control flag where each column
is defined as follows:

column 1    REJECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other
            than a period (.) in the FIRST column indicates
            a sample with obvious problems during collection
            or analysis.  This measurement should not be interpreted.

column 2    SELECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a
            period (.) in the SECOND column indicates a sample
            that is likely valid but does not meet selection
            criteria determined by the goals of a particular
            investigation.

column 3    INFORMATION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a period (.) 
            in the THIRD column provides additional information 
            about the collection or analysis of the sample.

            WARNING: A "P" in the 3rd column of the QC flag indicates
            the measurement result is preliminary and has not yet been 
            carefully examined by the PI.  The "P" flag is removed once 
            the quality of the measurement has been assessed.

Samples are collected in pairs, the pair  
difference is calculated, and samples with 
a pair difference greater than 0.5 ppm ("bad
pairs") are flagged.  Through 1988 one or both 
members of a bad pair were sometimes retained if
they fell within +/- 3 residual standard deviations
from a fitted curve.  From 1989 to the present, both
members of bad pairs have been automatically
rejected.  Retained and rejected flasks are
flagged as follows:

            Flag         Description

RETAINED    ...         (3 periods) good pair
                        (D <= 0.5 ppm)

            ..H         high member of bad
                        pair; retained

            ..L         low member of bad
                        pair; retained

            ..I         sample has also been measured
                        by another lab as part of
                        an intercomparison experiment

SELECTED    .X.         flagged automatically as an outlier, 
                        greater than 3 sigma from a fitted curve

            .Z.         flagged manually as an outlier
	                     (this is necessary to prevent 
                        distortion of the curve used for 
                        automated data selection)

REJECTED    +..         high member of bad
                        pair; rejected

            -..         low member of bad
                        pair; rejected

            *..         off scale or broken
                        flask; rejected

            N..         rejected due to  
                        error in sampling 
                        or analysis

            A..         rejected due to 
                        error in analysis

            T..         sample collected as
                        part of a methods
                        test; not used in
                        data analysis

The retained values comprise the data set that we feel
best represents the CO2 distribution in the remote,
well-mixed global or regional troposphere.  These
are the values we use to calculate long-term trends
and interannual and seasonal variations in our studies
of the global carbon cycle.  It is possible, and even
likely, that some of the values flagged as not
representative of background conditions are valid
measurements, but represent poorly mixed air masses
influenced by local or regional anthropogenic sources
or strong local biospheric sources or sinks.  Users of
these data should be aware that data selection is a
difficult but necessary aspect of the analysis and
interpretation of atmospheric trace gas data sets,
and the specific data selection scheme used may be
determined by the goals of a particular investigation.

7.6 DATA - MONTHLY AVERAGES

The monthly data files in ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/data/trace_gases/co2/flask/surface/ 
use the following naming scheme (see Section 7.2):

     [parameter]_[site]_[project]_[lab ID number]_[measurement group]_month.txt

(ex) CH4_pocn30_surface-flask_1_ccgg_month.txt contains CH4 ccgg monthly
     mean values for all surface flask samples collected on the Pacific
     Ocean Cruise sampling platform and grouped at 30N +/- 2.5 degrees.

(ex) CO2_brw_surface-flask_1_ccgg_month.txt contains CO2 ccgg monthly
     mean values for all surface flask samples collected at Barrow, Alaska.

Monthly means are produced for each site by first averaging all
valid measurement results in the event file with a unique sample
date and time.  Values are then extracted at weekly intervals from 
a smooth curve (Thoning et al., 1989) fitted to the averaged data 
and these weekly values are averaged for each month to give the 
monthly means recorded in the files.  Flagged data are excluded from the
curve fitting process.  Some sites are excluded from the monthly
mean directory because sparse data or a short record does not allow a
reasonable curve fit.  Also, if there are 3 or more consecutive months
without data, monthly means are not calculated for these months.

The data files contain multiple lines of header information 
followed by one line for each available month.

Fields are defined as follows:

Field 1:    [SITE CODE] The three-character sampling location code (see above).

Field 2:    [YEAR] The sample collection year and month.
Field 3:    [MONTH]

Field 4:    [MEAN VALUE] Computed monthly mean value

In these files a monthly mean value of -999.99 denotes months where there
are insufficient data to calculate a monthly mean.

8. DATA RETRIEVAL

To transfer all files in a directory, it is more efficient to 
download the tar or zipped files.  

To transfer a tar file, use the following steps from the ftp prompt:

   1. ftp> binary                    ! set transfer mode to binary
   2. ftp> get filename.tar.gz       ! transfer the file
   3. ftp> bye                       ! leave ftp

   4. $ gunzip filename.tar.gz       ! unzip your local copy
   5. $ tar xvf filename.tar         ! unpack the file

To transfer a zipped file, use the following steps from the ftp prompt:

   1. ftp> binary                    ! set transfer mode to binary
   2. ftp> get filename.zip          ! transfer the file
   3. ftp> bye                       ! leave ftp

   4. $ unzip filename.zip           ! uncompress your local copy
